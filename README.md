# SimpliMVVM
SimpliMVVM is our effort to create a simple and understandable MVVM Library. Idea here is to create a basic code structure that can be further extend based on the project needs.

# Why SimpliMVVM?
There are already lots of good article and library available on MVVM, then why you need SimpliMVVM?
Though there are lots of good material available, I personally find few libraries little complicated and there are lots of code which I might not need straightaway.
Therefore, I thought of creating Smipli a MVVM called SimpliMVVM.
